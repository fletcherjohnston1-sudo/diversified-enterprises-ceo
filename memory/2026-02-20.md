## Market Data Error & Fix (Feb 20, 2026)
- Chairman called out S&P 3-week downtrend — I reported it as UP (+0.21%), which was wrong
- My error: I quoted intraday futures without checking longer-term FRED trends
- Chairman provided correct breakdown:
  - Jan 31: ~6,939
  - Feb 13: ~6,836 (-1.4%)
  - Feb 18/19: ~6,862
  - Today: ~6,838
- Reality: -1.67% decline from Jan 28 peak (6,978.60)
- **Fix implemented:** Created `skills/market-data/SKILL.md` using FRED as primary source
- Added morning market brief cron (8 AM ET, Mon-Fri) — pulls from FRED, shows weekly/monthly/quarterly context

## Topic Routing Fix (Feb 20, 2026)
- Discovered CEO was responding in topic 36 (should be @CRO's topic)
- Root cause: No agent bindings in gateway config — CEO (default) handled all topics
- Added bindings: topic 36→@CRO, 37→@COO, 38→@CFO, 39→@CEO, 67→@CTO, 746→@Coach, 836→@Chef
- Gateway restarted — routing now correct

## Agent Naming Protocol (Feb 20, 2026)
- Chairman mandated: use @AgentName, not topic numbers
- Updated MEMORY.md with naming convention
- Pushed protocol to all agents

## CEO Session

- Chairman requested light mode for Mission Control
- CTO workspace unavailable (no active session), so implementing directly
- Updated theme.ts with dark/light color schemes
- Created useTheme.ts hook for theme context (later removed due to build errors)
- Added CSS variables for theming in globals.css
- Created ThemeInitializer component to prevent flash
- Updated Sidebar with theme toggle button
- Built and deployed successfully
- Light mode is now available at http://76.13.113.211:3000
- Changed Calendar to link directly to Google Calendar (opens in new tab)

## Mission Control Conversation Sync (Feb 20, 2026 @ 22:30 UTC)
- **Status:** SESSION RESET - Cannot fetch new messages
- **Messages synced:** 0

**Analysis:**
- Last successful sync: 22:00 UTC (4 messages synced)
- Current time: 22:30 UTC
- Topic sessions were RESET between 22:00-22:30 UTC (new session greetings visible)
- Session transcripts only contain: "✅ New session started" + greeting message
- **No Telegram messages can be fetched** - the OpenClaw message tool cannot fetch message history, only send
- The cron job relies on session transcripts which were cleared by session resets

**Technical Limitation:**
- OpenClaw message tool only supports: send, broadcast, react, delete, edit
- No capability to fetch/list historical messages from Telegram topics
- Session transcripts are cleared on session reset, losing message history
- Without Telegram Bot API token, cannot poll for new messages

**Messages by topic (last known state from 22:00 sync):**
| Topic | Agent | Last Sync | Messages in DB |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 36 | CRO | 22:00 UTC | 1 (Price watch) |
| 37 | COO | 22:00 UTC | 0 |
| 38 | CFO | 22:00 UTC | 0 |
| 39 | CEO | 22:00 UTC | 2 (morning reports deletion) |
| 67 | CTO | 22:00 UTC | 1 (light mode request) |

**Last sync:** 22:30 UTC (this run) - No new messages fetched due to session reset

**Recommendation for Chairman:**
To enable automatic syncing, one of these is needed:
1. **Telegram Bot API token** - Configure TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN in OpenClaw
2. **Prevent session resets** - Keep sessions alive to preserve transcript history
3. **Alternative sync mechanism** - Messages captured at receipt time rather than polling
