## Mission Control Dashboard - Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Project:** `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace-ceo/mission-control/`
**URL:** `http://76.13.113.211:3000/tasks`

### What Was Built
- Kanban-style task management with 3 columns (Backlog, In Progress, Done)
- Drag-and-drop using @dnd-kit/core
- Full CRUD operations via modal forms
- SQLite database with better-sqlite3
- Dark theme UI with responsive design
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading skeletons and error handling

### Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)
- SQLite + better-sqlite3
- Tailwind CSS
- @dnd-kit/core, lucide-react

### Key Files
- `src/components/tasks/KanbanBoard.tsx` — Main board with DnD context
- `src/components/tasks/KanbanColumn.tsx` — Droppable columns
- `src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` — Draggable cards
- `src/components/tasks/TaskModal.tsx` — Create/edit form
- `src/hooks/useTasks.ts` — Task data hook
- `src/app/globals.css` — Animations and responsive styles

### Issues Fixed
- **"use client" directive** — All components using hooks have `'use client'` at top
- **styled-jsx issue** — Removed `<style jsx global>` tags that caused "client-only" import errors. Moved styles to `globals.css` instead.
