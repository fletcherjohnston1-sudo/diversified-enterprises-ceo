# CEO Daily Memory - February 23, 2026

## Mission Control Conversation Sync - Feb 23, 2026 @ 00:07 UTC

**Status:** DISABLED - Technical Limitation

**Problem Identified:**
The `message` tool in OpenClaw only supports send/edit/delete/react operations — **it cannot fetch message history** from Telegram topics. Without the ability to retrieve messages, the sync job cannot:
1. Fetch new messages from topics 1, 36, 37, 38, 39, 67
2. Compare against last sync timestamp
3. POST new messages to the webhook

**What Was Tried:**
- Attempted to fetch messages via Telegram API (not available in message tool)
- Checked session transcripts (contain agent responses but not raw user messages)
- Tried to reach Mission Control on port 3000 — found stale next-server process
- Attempted rebuild — TypeScript error in cron/jobs/route.ts (fixed return type)
- Build succeeded but port 3000 remained stuck
- Started Mission Control on port 3001 — webhook works

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed TypeScript error in `/src/app/api/cron/jobs/route.ts` (added explicit return type)
- Started Mission Control on port 3001
- Webhook verified working: `POST /api/webhook/openclaw` returns `{"success":true,"conversation_id":942}`

**Action Taken:**
- Disabled cron job `170a5dcc-1599-4bb7-8a30-e8ab011cf346` (Mission Control Conversation Sync)
- Cron cannot function without message history capability

**Recommendation:**
Two options to re1. **Add-enable:
 message history capability** to OpenClaw's Telegram message plugin (add `list` or `history` action)
2. **Alternative approach**: Have the gateway log all incoming/outgoing Telegram messages to a local cache/file cron job can that this read

**Last sync from previous runs:** Feb 22 @ 23:30 UTC (5 messages identified but webhook unreachable at that time)

## Context Usage - Feb 23, 2026

**Ongoing Issue:** CEO main session and CTO topic 67 consistently at high usage (85-100%)

- CEO main: 88-93% throughout the day
- CTO topic 67: Hit 100% multiple times
- Other agents remain healthy (CRO 21%, CFO 39%, Coach 24%, COO 8%)

**No action taken** — sessions continue to function but may need attention soon.
