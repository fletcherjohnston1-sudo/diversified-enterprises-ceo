## Coach Agent Created
- **Workspace:** `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace-coach/`
- **Model:** Sonnet 4.5
- **Topic:** 746
- CTO created workspace files, populated MEMORY.md with all fitness data from old workspace

### Coach MEMORY.md Contents
- Training philosophy: "Absolute Mode" — moto-specific adaptations
- 2026 goals: Bench 5x5@225, VO2 Max intervals 4x4@8.5mph
- Full weekly structure (Mon-Sun)
- Recovery protocols (sauna, hot tub)
- Injury history (tricep resolved, shoulder issue with hanging knee raises)
- Recent workouts (Feb 10-11)
- Workout format preference: always sets × reps @ weight with warmups

### Coach Issues
- Coach not sending acknowledgments to Telegram properly at first
- Fixed: Updated AGENTS.md with correct topic directory (746 for Coach)
- Fixed: Added Task Delegation Protocol with explicit message tool examples
- Coach did eventually send message (id 765) but Chairman didn't see it — possible routing issue

## Investment Radar Skill Created
- Location: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace-ceo/skills/investment-radar/SKILL.md`
- Purpose: Weekly/monthly investment briefings from CFO + CRO data
- CEO synthesizes pre-digested data, never pulls raw Google Sheets directly
- Sections: Portfolio Snapshot, Theme Scorecard, Convergence Alerts, Silence Alerts, Pipeline Movement, Watchlist Candidates, Portfolio Gaps

## Agent Model Configuration
Verified all agents on correct models:
- CEO: Opus 4.5
- COO, CRO, CFO, CTO: MiniMax M2.5
- Coach: Sonnet 4.5

## Task Delegation Protocol
Updated all agent AGENTS.md files to require:
1. Immediately acknowledge in topic 39 when receiving task
2. Do the work
3. Report completion to topic 39

Chairman wants visibility on task acknowledgments in Telegram.

## OpenClaw Use Case Research (Feb 17, 2026 @ 23:46 UTC)
- Chairman requested: research OpenClaw use cases on X/Reddit, draft 3 skills, run every morning at 3am
- Note: "last30" skill does NOT exist — research done manually
- Cron job created (id: e5e96a76-b98a-4195-b89b-6be532a045a1): daily 3am UTC, isolated agent, researches use cases + sends skill drafts to topic 36
- Key use cases found: competitor scanning, health tracking, outreach automation, multi-agent startup teams
- **3 skills drafted and saved to workspace:**
  - `skills/competitor-radar/SKILL.md` — overnight competitor intel + morning brief
  - `skills/health-tracker/SKILL.md` — Whoop/Garmin/Strava health summaries
  - `skills/outreach-agent/SKILL.md` — end-to-end email/podcast outreach automation

## Agent Naming Protocol Update (Feb 18, 2026 @ 00:38 UTC)
- Chairman corrected: use **@AgentName** not topic numbers in ALL communications
- CEO pushed protocol update to all agents: @CTO, @CFO, @COO, @CRO, @Coach
- Updated MEMORY.md with naming convention rule
- All timeouts on send (agents will pick up on next active turn)
- This applies to: task delegations, reports, cross-agent comms, everything
