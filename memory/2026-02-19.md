## CEO Notes

### Portfolio Snapshot Request (Feb 19)
- Chairman requested fresh weekly portfolio snapshot via gog sheets
- **Failed**: gog CLI authentication is broken
  - Tried all 3 accounts (personal, claudiusjohnston1@gmail.com, openclaw-sheets)
  - Error: "Invalid impersonation" for service accounts
  - Token refresh also failed
- Need to re-authenticate gog or find alternative method

### Protocol Update
- **@agent naming convention**: Updated AGENTS.md and MEMORY.md to use @agent names (e.g., @CEO, @CTO, @CFO) instead of topic numbers in all communications
- Effective immediately for all agent-to-agent messaging

### Operations
- Added recurring cron job: **Schwab Re-Auth Reminder** — Runs Sundays at 9:00 AM ET to remind Fletcher to refresh Schwab API token
- Message includes full re-auth instructions (speed run process)

### Mission Control Fixes
- Fixed white-on-white project names in `/projects` page and `/projects/[id]` detail page
- Changed `text-white` to `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100` for proper dark mode visibility

### Projects Status
- Mission Control dashboard running at `http://76.13.113.211:3000`
- Kanban board fully functional with drag-and-drop
