## Quick Summary

Researched OpenClaw use cases from Reddit (past 30 days). Key findings:

### Top 3 Use Cases:
1. **Morning Briefings** — Personalized email/calendar/news digest, saves 20-30 min/day
2. **Inbox Triage** — Auto-sort/summarize (drafts only, no auto-send)
3. **Cross-App Data Sync** — Kill manual copy-paste between tools

### What Breaks Trust:
- High-stakes automation (form filling) — one mistake = abandoned
- Unclear ROI ($50/week credits vs. $5 with n8n)
- Security fears (ClawHub malware, CVEs)

## Three Skill Concepts:

### 1️⃣ **Morning Command Center** (`morning-brief`)
Daily digest: email, calendar, news, weather → Telegram with action buttons.  
**Why:** #1 use case, low-stakes, saves 20-30 min/day.

### 2️⃣ **Deal Room Watcher** (`deal-radar`)
Overnight competitor monitoring (sites, HN, Reddit, SEC filings).  
**Why:** Replaces $200-500/mo tools, runs 24/7.

### 3️⃣ **No-UI Publisher** (`headless-publisher`)
Update CMS (Strapi, WordPress) via Telegram instead of admin UI.  
**Why:** Real user pain point ("I hated the Strapi UI").

## Recommendation:
Prototype **Morning Command Center** first — highest adoption signals, lowest risk.

**Next Action:** Chairman to review full report and select priority skill for prototyping.
