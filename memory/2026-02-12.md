## Tradier Paper Trading - ACTIVE ✅
- API key: `qTAVQEo9NAvmzskkSwqTJqcycFLZ`
- Account: VA2376900 (margin, option level 6)
- Starting balance: $100,000
- Current: $99,738.01 cash + 1 AAPL share

### First Trade
- Order ID: 25417495
- Buy 1 AAPL @ $261.99 (filled)

### Risk Limits (Chairman-set)
- Max 10% portfolio per position
- 2% daily loss limit
- Paper trading only until Chairman authorizes live

## Telegram Forum Setup - COMPLETE ✅
- Group ID: `-1003884162218`
- Group name: "Diversified Enterprises"
- Forum mode: enabled
- All topics configured and tested
- requireMention: false (all topics respond automatically)

## Model Configuration Journey
1. Started: All agents on Opus
2. Switched: All agents to Kimi
3. CEO: Kimi → Sonnet (Chairman directive)
4. CTO added: Initially had model path issues
5. Fixed: CTO now on `openrouter/openai/gpt-5.2-codex`

## CTO Position Created
- Added specifically for dashboard development
- Running Codex for coding strength
- Workspace: `~/.openclaw/workspace-cto`
- SOUL.md defines responsibilities and authority
- Reports to CEO, escalates major decisions
- Tested and confirmed working

## Technical Details
- Agent-to-agent communication enabled
- All agents in `tools.agentToAgent.allow` list
- OpenRouter API handles all models (including Codex)
- Forum topic routing via bindings with `:topic:<id>` syntax

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Chairman role defined**: User has final authority; CEO handles ops, escalates major decisions
2. **Paper trading limits**: 10% position cap, 2% daily loss limit
3. **Forum structure**: Separate topics for each executive domain
4. **Model assignments**: CEO=Sonnet, CTO=Codex, others=Kimi
5. **CTO position**: Added for technical work, especially dashboard development

## Communication Flow
Chairman can:
- DM the CEO for private strategic discussions
- Post in General or CEO Office for CEO attention
- Post in department topics for specific executives
- Each topic maintains separate conversation history

## Next Steps
Dashboard development with CTO in Tech topic - APPROACH REVISED (see below)

## Management Protocol (Chairman directive - 2026-02-12 21:06 UTC)
**Task Delegation Process:**
When assigning work to any executive, they must acknowledge:
1. Receipt of the assignment
2. Understanding of scope/tasks
3. Active work status (or blockers if any)

No silent starts. Confirmation loop required until team communication is well-established.

## Config Changes - 2026-02-12 21:08 UTC
- Added `tools.alsoAllow: ["message"]` globally
- All executives now have message tool for direct Telegram posting
- Gateway restarted successfully

## Dashboard Fix Attempt - 2026-02-12 21:10-21:47 UTC
**Task assigned to CTO:**
1. Fix portfolio performance refresh button (Tradier API integration)
2. Make project titles editable

**What went wrong:**
- CTO rebuilt/replaced the dashboard instead of adding features incrementally
- Lost almost all original functionality
- Chairman ordered revert

**Lesson learned:**
- Must be explicit: "ADD features to existing code, do NOT rebuild"
- Backup before ANY changes
- CTO acknowledged new approach: incremental additions only

**Current state:**
- Dashboard reverted to original via git clean
- Backup created: `kanban-dashboard.backup-20260212-2123.html`
- Server running on port 8080
- Access URL: `http://76.13.113.211:8080/kanban-dashboard.html`
- Features NOT yet added (waiting for approval to proceed with correct approach)

## Dashboard Access Details
- Server IP: 76.13.113.211
- Port: 8080
- URL: `http://76.13.113.211:8080/kanban-dashboard.html`
- Local only won't work if Chairman is remote

## CFO Tradier Access - Confirmed
CFO has full Tradier API access documented in their TOOLS.md:
- API key, account number, working curl commands
- Risk controls documented
- Ready for dashboard integration

## Model Override - 2026-02-12 21:47-21:49 UTC
- Chairman requested Opus 4.6
- Added `openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` to allowed models (alias: Opus46)
- Session model override applied: openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4.6
- Opus 4.6 is Anthropic's strongest model for coding and long-running professional tasks

## P0 PROJECT: Command Center Dashboard - 2026-02-12 21:49 UTC

**Status:** INITIATED  
**Priority:** P0 (blocks other initiatives)  
**Target:** MVP launch Feb 16 (4 days)  
**Approved by:** Chairman

### Scope
Unified decision interface consolidating:
- Portfolio data (Tradier integration)
- Project tracking (existing kanban functionality)  
- Agent escalations (pending decisions queue)

### Assignments
| Executive | Task | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| CTO | Review technical brief, propose architecture, build | ✅ Acknowledged |
| Chief of Staff | Define outcome metrics for tracking | 📤 Assigned |

### Key Decisions
- This is a FRESH BUILD, not a patch to old dashboard
- Previous dashboard fix task superseded
- Chairman posting technical brief to CTO topic

### Timeline
- Day 1 (Feb 12): Technical brief, architecture proposal
- Day 2-3 (Feb 13-14): Core build
- Day 4 (Feb 15): Integration and testing
- Feb 16: MVP launch

### Notes
- CTO instructed to propose architecture BEFORE building
- Daily progress updates required
- Learned from previous failure: design first, incremental approach

### Full Technical Brief Received - 21:54 UTC

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Streamlit (Python)
- Data: JSON file store in `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/data/`
- APIs: Tradier (have it), Google Calendar (TBD creds)
- Hosting: Local first → VPS
- Updates: Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

**Data Architecture:**
```
data/
├── portfolio.json   (CFO updates every 4h)
├── projects.json    (Chief of Staff updates daily)
├── decisions.json   (Agents append escalations)
├── metrics.json     (North star goals and actuals)
└── calendar.json    (Sync from Google Calendar API)
```

**JSON Schemas Defined:**
- portfolio.json: total_value, daily/mtd/ytd_change_pct, positions array, alerts
- projects.json: name, health_score (0-100), outcome_progress_pct, trajectory, owner, next_milestone, blockers, target_date
- decisions.json: id, title, urgency, project, impact, deadline, context_link, requesting_agent
- metrics.json: north_star array with name, target, actual, unit
- calendar.json: events array with title, start, end, location

**Health Score Color Coding:**
- Green: >75
- Yellow: 50-75
- Red: <50

**Constraints:**
- Budget: $0 (free APIs only)
- Timeline: 4 days firm
- CTO capacity: 20 hours

**Deliverables:**
- Feb 13 EOD: Streamlit app + mock JSON + all panels with test data
- Feb 14 EOD: Portfolio API + Calendar API + agents can write to JSON
- Feb 15: Chairman UAT, bug fixes, performance
- Feb 16: VPS deployment + documentation

**CTO Architecture Proposal (Received):**
- Clean file structure with services/, components/, data/ directories
- Estimated 19-22 hours total
- Blockers answered: Use Tradier, CoS provides health scores, data in shared workspace

**Status:** Technical brief delivered, CTO cleared to begin building

### Sample Data Provided - 21:56 UTC
Chairman provided sample JSON data for CTO to use during development:
- portfolio.json: AAPL + NVDA positions, $250K total value
- projects.json: Command Center (88 health) + Infrastructure Upgrade (67 health)
- decisions.json: AAPL rebalancing decision pending

### Day 1 Progress - 23:05 UTC Check-in

**CTO DELIVERED DAY 1 MILESTONE:**
- ✅ Streamlit scaffold running at `http://127.0.0.1:8501`
- ✅ Reading from sample JSON files in `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/data/`
- ✅ Layout matches brief (North Star, Portfolio, Focus, Calendar, Project Health, Decision Queue)
- ✅ Screenshot captured

**Blocker:** External access needs firewall config or reverse proxy for Chairman to view remotely

**Next (Feb 14):** Tradier API + Calendar API + agent JSON writes

### API Integration Started - 23:09 UTC

**Chairman directive:** Begin API integration immediately.

**Google Calendar - ALREADY CONFIGURED!**
Found existing setup in main workspace:
- OAuth creds: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/.secrets/google-oauth-credentials.json`
- Tokens: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/.secrets/google-calendar-tokens.json` (already authorized)
- Helper code: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/calendar_sync.py`
- Auth script: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/authorize_calendar.py`
- Calendar name: "claudius" (secondary calendar)

**Tradier - Ready**
- Creds: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/config/tradier.json`
- API Key: `qTAVQEo9NAvmzskkSwqTJqcycFLZ`
- Account: VA2376900
- Base URL: `https://sandbox.tradier.com/v1`

**CTO sent full integration details at 23:09 UTC** - includes credential paths, endpoints, and reference code locations

### Rapid Progress - 23:12-23:26 UTC

**Chairman timezone:** Eastern (EST) - 9 PM EST = 02:00 UTC

**CTO Completed:**
1. ✅ Tradier API integration - live portfolio data
2. ✅ Google Calendar integration - live events
3. ✅ Agent JSON write scripts with validation:
   - `update_portfolio.py` (CFO)
   - `update_projects.py` (Chief of Staff)
   - `append_decision.py` (All agents)
   - Docs: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/command-center/README.json-updates.md`
4. ✅ North Star metrics panel - color-coded progress bars
5. ✅ Sparklines section - 4 trend charts
6. ✅ Auto-refresh (5 min) + manual "🔄 Refresh now" button
7. ✅ Performance: ~0.003s load time (well under 3s target)
8. ✅ Project Health panel enhanced to full spec

**Mobile responsiveness ON HOLD** - Chairman wants to evaluate current state first

**Project Management:**
- File: `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/data/projects.json`
- Chairman added "Fishing" project at 23:26 UTC
- Projects support: name, health_score, outcome_progress_pct, trajectory (up/stable/down), owner, next_milestone, blockers, target_date

**Scheduled Updates:**
Set 5 cron jobs for progress updates every 30 min until 9 PM EST:
- 6:45 PM, 7:15 PM, 7:45 PM, 8:15 PM, 8:45 PM EST

**Status:** MVP core features COMPLETE ahead of schedule (Day 1 of 4-day sprint)

### Projects Page Added - 23:28-00:10 UTC

**Chairman request:** Click Project Health → dedicated Projects page with tiles, sorting, filters

**Implemented:**
1. ✅ Multi-page Streamlit app structure (`pages/1_Projects.py`)
2. ✅ Tile/card layout (3-column grid)
3. ✅ Sort by: Health Score, Progress %, Target Date, Name
4. ✅ Filter by: Owner, Health status (Green/Yellow/Red)
5. ✅ Add New Project form (saves to projects.json)

**Issues encountered:**
- Initial `st.page_link` caused KeyError - had to use native Streamlit multi-page structure
- Streamlit needed restart to pick up pages/ folder
- Navigation via sidebar now works

**Chairman feedback:** "Always debug and test new features before presenting them"
- CTO must test features before reporting completion

**Final working state:**
- Sidebar shows: "app" (main dashboard) and "Projects" 
- URL: http://76.13.113.211:8501/Projects
- Projects page has filters, sorting, tiles, and add form

**App location:** `/home/clawd/.openclaw/workspace/command-center/`
- `app.py` - main dashboard
- `pages/1_Projects.py` - projects list with tiles, filters, sorting
- `pages/2_Project_Detail.py` - individual project view

### Project Detail Page Added - 00:26-00:41 UTC

**Chairman request:** Click project → detail page with To Do, Notes, and 2 more features

**Implemented:**
1. ✅ **To Do List** - Tasks with checkboxes, add new task
2. ✅ **Notes** - Free-form text area
3. ✅ **Milestones** - Title + date, mark complete
4. ✅ **Activity Log** - Tracks changes with timestamps

**Navigation flow:**
- Main dashboard → sidebar "Projects" → project tiles → "📂 Open Project" link → detail page
- URL pattern: `/Project_Detail?project=ProjectName`

**Data persistence:**
- All project data (tasks, notes, milestones, activity) stored in `projects.json`
- "Save Changes" button commits changes

**Minor warning:** Streamlit logged a label warning for text_area (cosmetic, not breaking)
