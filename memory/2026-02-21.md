## CEO Notes

### Chef Agent Fix
- Chef wasn't responding to any messages (topic 836)
- Root cause: Chef was missing from `agents.list` in config - only binding existed
- Fix: Added all 7 agents to config (CEO, CRO, COO, CFO, CTO, Coach, Chef) via config.patch
- Gateway restarted after fix

### Problem Scout Activated
- Fletcher provided Problem Scout orchestration playbook
- First /scout request: Kitchen towels - aesthetic vs absorbency tradeoff
- Problem Frame generated and delegated to CRO (topic 36)
- Tier 1 Surface Scan complete: Score 6.3/10 (Borderline)
- Awaiting Fletcher's /dig or /pass response

### Chef Status
- Fletcher said Chef responded well last night before going silent
- Likely a config reset that wiped the agent registration
- Should be working now after the fix
